## Privacy Policy 
This Privacy Policy is subject to updates, so we recommend revisiting it periodically.

"ChatGPT Voice Shortcut" does not collect any personal data. 

To adapt to ChatGPT's frequent DOM changes, the extension fetches an updated static file from a GitHub-hosted repository. This file provides the necessary information for the extension to function properly.

We encourage users to review GitHub's [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement) for more details about their data handling practices.

This Privacy Policy may change in the future. Please check back regularly for updates.
